# Project Name
Fullstack To-Do-List 


## Description

This application is a fullstack application that will allow users to create a to do list. Users will input their task with the provided fields on the browser and these tasks will then be stored on a database. Once the user deem the task completed, the user will enter the completion date and mark the task as completed. The browser will visually update itself to show the change in completion status. The completion status will also be recorded in the database along with the date it was completed. If the user wishes to delete a task off the list, there is a button for the user to remove that specific task from the browser and database. This application was created using jquery to assist the user's interaction with the browser. It also uses express, node.js and the REST methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to allow for data communication with the server and back to the user.
